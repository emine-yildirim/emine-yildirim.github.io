Hi! I am an INI-Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at the Isaac Newton Institute; University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Math Department](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/home) of [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca) until July 2021. I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](http://lacim.uqam.ca/chercheurs/) in 2018.

I was one of the organizers of the [Virtual Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/arta2021/).
