Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds, working with [Karin Baur](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtkb/).

I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](https://lacim.uqam.ca/membres-reguliers/) in 2018. I was an [INI](https://www.newton.ac.uk)-Simons Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, and before that a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), Queen's University. 

I am one of the organisers of the [ARTA IX](https://sites.google.com/view/arta9/home) to be held in 2023. I was one of the organizers of the [Virtual Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/arta2021/) and I co-organized a [seminar series](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/car/) at the Isaac Newton Institute under the Cluster algebras and representation theory (CAR) program.
