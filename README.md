Hi! I am currently a researcher in [the Quantum Groups and Cluster Algebras group](https://icms.bg/research-groups/quantum-groups-and-cluster-algebras/) at [the International Center for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) - Sofia](https://icms.bg/), hosted by the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (IMI–BAS) in Sofia. 

I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](https://uqam.academia.edu/HughThomas) in 2018. I was an [INI](https://www.newton.ac.uk)-Simons Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge in 2021. Here is a [link](https://www.newton.ac.uk/media/podcasts/post/meet-the-simons-postdoctoral-fellows-mini-series-1-dr-emine-yildirim/) to an episode of Living Proof podcast with Dan Aspel about being in INI/Cambridge as an early career researcher. Before Cambridge, I was a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), Queen's University and also a research fellow in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds.

I was one of the organisers of the [CLAN (Clusters and their Applications in the North)](https://clan-clusterstructures.github.io) and [Leeds Algebra Seminar](https://emine-yildirim.github.io/Leeds_Seminars_2023-24.html).

I was one of the organizers of [Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras IX](https://sites.google.com/view/arta9/home) at Queen's University in 2023 and the [Virtual ARTA 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/arta2021/). I co-organized a [seminar series](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/car/) at the Isaac Newton Institute under the Cluster algebras and representation theory (CAR) program.
