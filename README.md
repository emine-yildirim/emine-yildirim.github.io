Hi! I am an INI-Simons Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), Queen's University. I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](https://lacim.uqam.ca/membres-reguliers/) in 2018.

I was one of the organizers of the [Virtual Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/arta2021/) and I am currently organizing a [seminar series](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/car/) at the Isaac Newton Institute under the Cluster algebra and representation theory (CAR) program.
