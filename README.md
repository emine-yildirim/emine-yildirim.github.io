## Welcome to Emine's Space Station

Hi! I am a 4th year graduate student at [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/). I am working with [Hugh Thomas](http://www.math.uqam.ca/une_page.php?id=72) towards my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) lab.

I will update this page soon with research related material. In the meantime, here is my [tumblr page](http://yildirimemine.tumblr.com) where I put some of the photographs I take.
