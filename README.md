Hi! I am currently a researcher in [the Quantum Groups and Cluster Algebras group](https://icms.bg/research-groups/quantum-groups-and-cluster-algebras/) at [the International Center for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) - Sofia](https://icms.bg/), hosted by the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (IMI–BAS) in Sofia. 

I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](https://uqam.academia.edu/HughThomas) in 2018. I was an [INI](https://www.newton.ac.uk)-Simons Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge in 2021. Here is a [link](https://www.newton.ac.uk/media/podcasts/post/meet-the-simons-postdoctoral-fellows-mini-series-1-dr-emine-yildirim/) to an episode of Living Proof podcast with Dan Aspel about being in INI/Cambridge as an early career researcher. Before Cambridge, I was a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/), Queen's University and also a research fellow in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) at the University of Leeds.

Along with [Milen Yakimov](https://yakimov.sites.northeastern.edu/), we organize [Quantum Group and Cluster Algebra](https://sites.google.com/view/quantum-gps-and-cluster-algs/activities?authuser=0) conferences in ICMS - Sofia.
