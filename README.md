Hi! I am a Coleman Research Fellow at the [Math Department](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/home) of [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca). I completed my PhD at the [LACIM](http://lacim.uqam.ca/) with [Hugh Thomas](http://lacim.uqam.ca/chercheurs/).

I am the co-organizer of the [Geometry and Representation Theory Seminars](https://mast.queensu.ca/~georep/) and Algebra Working Seminars at the math department.

I am one of the organizers of the [Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras VIII](https://mast.queensu.ca/~arta2020/). Due to COVID-19, it is postponed. For further information, please contact me.
