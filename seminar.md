Benjamin Horton (University of Leeds) 

Manifolds, Cobordisms, Braids and Loop Braids.

 We consider a categorifieed version of the category of manifolds and cobordisms, in the form of a pseudo-double category of manifolds, collared cobordisms, and equivalence classes of certain collar compatible diffeomorphisms between cobordisms. We discuss why this is the appropriate setting to formulate the monoidal categories of generalised braids and loop braids. We aim to give a pedagogical talk, and we will not assume previous knowledge on topological quantum field theory.

Gram Determinants motivated by Knot Theory. 

 In the 1990's, a general formula for the Gram determinant of Type A was formulated in order to prove the existence and uniqueness of Lickorish's construct of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of 3-manifolds. Since then, various types of Gram determinants have been created from knot theory by using crossingless connections in surfaces with boundary. In this talk we will introduce the different types and present recent work on the progress to proving a closed formula for a particularly complicated conjectured closed formula for the Gram determinant of Type Mb. We will end with observations and questions about the potential connection between Gram determinants motivated by knot theory and statistical mechanics.

A Generalization of Kitaev's quantum double models

We describe a construction inspired by Kitaev's quantum double models 
and related to factorization homology. It assigns to an embedded graph 
on an oriented surface S and a Hopf monoid in a (co)complete symmetric 
monoidal category C an object in C that depends only on S, equipped with 
an action of the mapping class group Map(S).

We determine this object explicitly for simplicial groups and crossed 
modules as Hopf monoids in SSet and in Cat.  For the latter this yields 
a groupoid with representation varieties Hom(pi_1(S), B)/B as objects 
and certain equivalence classes of representation varieties as morphisms.

This is based on joint work with Thomas Voss and Anna-Katharina Hirmer.
