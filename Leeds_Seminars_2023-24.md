Farrokh Atai (University of Leeds)

Vertex operator algebra and super-Jack polynomials

 The fruitful interplay between representation theory and the theory of special functions has led to many interesting discoveries in mathematical physics. Moreover, it is known that representations of certain infinite dimensional algebras can be used to give a mathematical formulation of some quantum field theories.

In this talk, I will recall how highest weight representations of certain affine Kac-Moody algebras are given by field operators and symmetric functions. Using the field operators, we can construct vertex operator with interesting applications in mathematical physics. By considering a one-parameter extension of these vertex operators, we also find that they are closely related to the integrable Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models. In particular, we find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space spanned by these vertex operators and the so-called super-Jack polynomials. If time permits, I will also discuss how this approach can be used to construct a Laurent polynomial generalization of the super-Jack polynomials.

Some representation theory of Kadar-Martin-Yu algebras

Kadar-Martin-Yu introduced a new chain of subalgebras of the Brauer algebra. These algebras start with Temperley-Lieb and end with the Brauer algebra and build in representation theoretic intensity. This gives a new tool to tackle the long standing problem of understanding the representation theory of the Brauer algebra. We present an introduction to these new algebras and some results about their representation theory. This is joint work with my PhD student N. M. Alraddadi.

Jeffrey Hicks (University of Edinburgh)  

Resolutions from the perspective of symplectic geometry

One of the great insights of homological algebra is that one can resolve a complicated object into a complex of simpler ones. This talk will look at resolutions from several different perspectives - commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, topology, and differential geometry. We will then see how resolutions appear naturally in symplectic geometry, focusing on examples in real dimension 2 (so we may draw everything on the board - no background in symplectic geometry is needed for the talk!). Time permitting, I'll discuss some applications to toric varieties:
 - how applying the mirror symmetry dictionary to this perspective provides minimal-length resolutions for toric subvarieties,
 - compute the diagonal dimension (and consequently Rouquier dimension) of the derived category of coherent sheaves of a toric variety.
   
All work is joint with Andrew Hanlon and Oleg Lazarev.
