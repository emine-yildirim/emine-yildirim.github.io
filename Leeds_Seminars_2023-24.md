Vertex operator algebra and super-Jack polynomials

 The fruitful interplay between representation theory and the theory of special functions has led to many interesting discoveries in mathematical physics. Moreover, it is known that representations of certain infinite dimensional algebras can be used to give a mathematical formulation of some quantum field theories.

In this talk, I will recall how highest weight representations of certain affine Kac-Moody algebras are given by field operators and symmetric functions. Using the field operators, we can construct vertex operator with interesting applications in mathematical physics. By considering a one-parameter extension of these vertex operators, we also find that they are closely related to the integrable Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models. In particular, we find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space spanned by these vertex operators and the so-called super-Jack polynomials. If time permits, I will also discuss how this approach can be used to construct a Laurent polynomial generalization of the super-Jack polynomials.
